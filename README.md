# 30DayMapChallenge2020Metadata

Topi Tjukanov is doing it again: [#30DayMapChallenge is returning in November 2020](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge)!

Last year [I collated submissions](https://github.com/dakvid/30DayMapChallenge) from Twitter and made [my own gallery](https://david.frigge.nz/30DayMapChallenge/).
But the repository was large with saved map images, and it wasn't that easy for everyone to collaborate. Plus I didn't start until late November or early December.
Hopefully this year - with pre-planning, a separate text-only repository and Google Sheets - we can get some good crowdsourcing going.
I'll aim to create a similar interactive gallery, but it will also be easier for others to do their own analysis or visualisations of the submissions.
